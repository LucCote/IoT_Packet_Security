get device IP (from user)

observe traffic rate from device while user interacts with it and find 50th percentile and max traffic rate
implement traffic shaper with limit at 50th percentile

last_usable_limit = max traffic rate

ask user if device is still usable
if yes:
    averager = 0
    last_usable_limit = current limit
if no:
    averager = max traffic rate

loop until absolute value of averager - current limit <= 1:
    old_limit = current traffic shaping limit
    set new limit at halfway between averager and current traffic shaping limit
    ask user if still usable
    if yes:
        averager = 0
        last_usable_limit = current limit
    if no:
        averager = old_limit;

once loop ends the value of last_usable_limit is the optimal traffic shaping limit
