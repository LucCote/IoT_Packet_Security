# IoT_Packet_Security
This is a project which looks into what traffic from common IoT Devices can tell us about their user's behavior

# Materials
This project uses a [Raspberry Pi acess point](https://thepi.io/how-to-use-your-raspberry-pi-as-a-wireless-access-point/) as the connection point for the IoT Devices.

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and [wondershaper](https://www.tecmint.com/wondershaper-limit-network-bandwidth-in-linux/) were used to monitor the device traffic and set traffic shaping limits.

# Usage
After capturing the packets from your IoT Device using wireshark, input the correct fields into the
